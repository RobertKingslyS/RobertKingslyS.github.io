											There are many misconceptions about the Christian life, and one is that it is boring. The truth is the Christian life is where we find true joy and lasting peace, hope and contentment. These things, like all good and perfect things, come from God (James 1:17). Sometimes, a new Christian is surprised that his new life is not “more exciting,” as if the Christian life is supposed to be a thrill-a-minute extravaganza. No life is that. Boredom is something we must all overcome. Everyone stands in line at the grocery store, gets caught in traffic, or is given jobs he’d rather not do.

Part of the problem may be how “boredom” is defined. Is it a lack of excitement? Nothing can stimulate perpetual exhilaration. Is it inactivity? If so, then the key is to find something to do. Is it uninterest? If so, the key is to be more curious. Is it a lack of “fun”? In that case, “fun” needs to be defined, since “fun” is itself a highly subjective concept.

                                                                            <p>
                                                                                Some people assume that being a Christian is boring because they’ve heard that Christians have to give up all the “fun” things in life. It’s true that Christians give up some things, but it’s not the fun. Christians give up their sin, their self-destructive behavior, their addictions, their negative attitudes and their ignorance of God. In return, they receive “righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit” (Romans 14:17). They “live as children of light” in a dark world (Ephesians 5:8). The mistakes of their past no longer have a stronghold in their lives. They no longer live for themselves but for the One who died for them. They serve others and make a difference (Romans 14:7; Philippians 2:4). They are becoming everything that God created them to be. It is virtually impossible to be bored in such a life. 
                                                                            </p> 
										<p>
											A growing, committed Christian will find that life is never boring. There’s always another step of faith to take, another relationship to build, another person to serve.

Is the Christian life supposed to be “boring”? Absolutely not. Jesus said, “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (John 10:10).
