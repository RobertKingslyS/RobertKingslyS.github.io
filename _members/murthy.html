bio : I am interested in working on the classical problems of open channel flows such as critical depth, end depth, and gradually varied water surface profiles.Â  I have developed computationally efficient algorithms for GVF computation in tree type and also looped open channel networks. I have worked on computation of open channel flows with shocks, such as dam break flows and supercritical flows. Two-dimensional shallow water equations are solved for this purpose. I have also developed computational methods for analysis of open-channel flows with non-hydrostatic pressure distribution. We looked at the movement of a dam break wave, impact of surges on inclined walls (forces and run up heights), and analysis of open channel flows with multiple free surfaces. A variant of GENSMAC method along with VOF technique was used for this purpose.
