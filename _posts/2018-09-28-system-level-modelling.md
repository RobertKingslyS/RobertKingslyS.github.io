<br>Systems-Level Modelling of Microbial Communities: Theory and Practice introduces various aspects of modelling microbial communities and presents a detailed overview of the computational methods which have been developed in this area. This book is aimed at researchers in the field of computational/systems biology as well as biologists/experimentalists studying microbial communities, who are keen on embracing the concepts of computational modelling. The primary focus of this book is on methods for modelling interactions between micro-organisms in a community, with special emphasis on constraint-based and network-based modelling techniques. A brief overview of population- and agent-based modelling is also presented. Lastly, it covers the experimental methods to understand microbial communities, and provides an outlook on how the field may evolve in the coming years.
