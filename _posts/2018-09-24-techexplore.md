Researchers at the Robert Bosch Center for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence and Center for Computational Brain Research, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, and Purdue University have recently developed a new method of reducing computational requirements for object detection in videos using neural networks. Their technique, called Pack and Detect (PaD), was outlined in a paper pre-published on arXiv.
