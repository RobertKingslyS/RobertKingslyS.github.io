Welcome to Northern Frontier, our video interview series that showcases in-depth and engaging conversations with some of the brightest academic minds in AI research today.

<br>Last month, we took Prof. Balaraman Ravindran, professor of Reinforcement Learning at the Indian Institute of Technology at Madras and head of the schoolâ€™s Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, to a noisy arcade at a converted airport hangar just north of Edmonton. In between Atari battles, we discussed why games are a crucial way to learn how to solve much bigger, more complex problems, the pros and cons of scalar rewards, and the natural link between RL and deep learning.
